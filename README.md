# Keypress Emulator  
This project uses PIC18F2550 micro-controller to send keypress commands to PC, just like USB HID Keyboards.

### Project Idea
Actually few of my friends works in a company, where the employer has started tracking the daily activities of employees using some dedicated software's.  
They track everything, like for how much time, they have spend on Skype chatting with friends, how much time they spend on actual work related tools like that.  
And based on the tracking details, the software calculates the actual amount of work done by employee and this information is also shared with their managers.  
They don't have any idea how to handle this situation, and from here I got an idea to make a simple device which looks like a USB keyboard to PC and sends some random commands pre-programmed in it, by this the tracking software's will think that the employee is doing their work, but actually it's the device which is automatically sending the key-press to PC.  

## Future Projects
* Automating Repetitive Tasks which requires Keyboard and Mouse.
* Customized USB HID based Keyboards
